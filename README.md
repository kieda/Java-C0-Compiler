Java_C0_Compiler
================

What is this?
    A compiler of C0 code, written in java, parsed to java bytecode. 
    More about C0 : c0.typesafety.net
Intent:
    compatability of compiled C0 across multiple systems
    ease of use on local machines (instead of compiling on the cmu-andrew-linux servers)
    additional versatility and imporovements to CC0 
        (including unordered methods, additional readout on compilation errors.)
