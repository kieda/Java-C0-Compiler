Java_C0_Compiler
================

What is this?<br>
-----------------
A compiler of C0 code, written in java, parsed to java bytecode.<br>
More about C0 : http://c0.typesafety.net

Intent:<br>
-----------------
<ul>
    <li>compatability of compiled C0 across multiple systems<br>
    <li>ease of use on local machines (instead of compiling on the cmu-andrew-linux servers)<br>
    <li>additional versatility and improvements to CC0. This includes...<br>
    <ul>
        <li> methods, structs, typedefs, etc. are not parsed in order
        <li> additional readout on compilation errors, the code does not break when an error is reached
        <li> recursive compilation
        <li> redistributable across multiple platforms
        <li> greater ability to be used on personal computers
    </ul>
</ul>


Version v.8 (almost finished), 1200+ lines of code
