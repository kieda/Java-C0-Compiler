Important Note  : Deprecated after making C0++, a compiler that goes directly to jvm bytecode
C0++ will be released after my parter and I change the front-end a significant amount (to avoid other students searching for a 411 reference solution for C0)

Older Readme:

Java C0 Compiler
================

What is this?<br>
-----------------
A compiler from C0 code to java bytecode.<br>
More about C0 : http://c0.typesafety.net

Intent:<br>
-----------------
<ul>
    <li>compatability of compiled C0 across multiple systems<br>
    <li>ease of use on local machines (instead of compiling on the cmu-andrew-linux servers)<br>
    <li>additional versatility and improvements to CC0. This includes...<br>
    <ul>
        <li> methods, structs, typedefs, etc. are not parsed in order
        <li> additional readout on compilation errors, the code does not break when an error is reached
        <li> redistributable across multiple platforms
        <li> greater ability to be used on personal computers
    </ul>
</ul>


Version v.8 (almost in alpha)
